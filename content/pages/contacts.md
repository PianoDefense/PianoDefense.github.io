You may create covers or remixes based on my piano tutorials, sheet music, or MIDI/audio files. You may also use the audio from my videos as background music for your own videos. Please credit my [channel](https://www.youtube.com/pianobin) when possible.

If you create something based on my piano arrangements, please don't hesitate to show me! I would love to see your creative work.
